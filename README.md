In this work, we present Recursive Cross-Modal Attention across audio, visual and text modalities for dimensional emotion recognition. We submitted our results on test set for Valence arousal challenge of 6th ABAW competition. 

The proposed model is developed based on the coding framework provided by @sucv (https://github.com/sucv/ABAW3). Thanks to the authors for sharing the coding framework.
